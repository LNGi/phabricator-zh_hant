  'Send a message about the status of a build target to Harbormaster, notifying the application of build results in an external system.\\n\\nSending Messages\\n================\\nIf you run external builds, you can use this method to publish build results back into Harbormaster after the external system finishes work or as it makes progress.\\n\\nThe simplest way to use this method is to call it once after the build finishes with a `pass` or `fail` message. This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.\\n\\nWhen you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.\\n\\nIf you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn\'t completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn\'t have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.\\n\\nMessage Types\\n=============\\nWhen you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbomaster that a build completed successfully.\\n\\nSupported message types are:\\n\\n%s\\n\\nUnit Results\\n============\\nYou can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.\\n\\nTo provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result shoud be a dictionary with these keys:\\n\\n%s\\n\\nThe `result` parameter recognizes these test results:\\n\\n%s\\n\\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:\\n\\n\\n\\n```lang=json\\n%s```\\n\\nLint Results\\n============\\nLike unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:\\n\\n%s\\n\\nThe `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:\\n\\n%s\\n\\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:\\n\\n```lang=json\\n%s```\\n\\n' => NULL,
